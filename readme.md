# Fame Clash â€” Higher or Lower Game ðŸŽ¯

A Python command-line game where players guess which celebrity has the higher score (based on fame, fortune, or influence). Inspired by the classic "Higher or Lower" format.

## ðŸ§  How It Works
- Two random public figures (A & B) are shown.
- You guess who has the higher score.
- Score increases with correct guesses â€” one wrong move ends the game!

## ðŸš€ Features
- Easy-to-read CLI format
- Randomized celebrity comparisons
- Score tracking
- Replay option
- Clean, modular Python structure
